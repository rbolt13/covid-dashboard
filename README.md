This repository contains the code used to create [Covid Dashboard](https://rbolt13.github.io/covid-dashboard/).

Covid Dashboard is an interactive analysis tool that specifically examines Covid-19 cases and fatalities in both the United States and my home state of Oregon. What initially began as a class project at the onset of the pandemic, it has undergone multiple iterations and refinements to evolve into a fully functional and informative dashboard.
